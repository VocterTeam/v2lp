1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,450
they report on landing site is through

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,690
suggesting the death takeoff off-road

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:20,299
intestines will I fall in an expensive

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:20,300
basic reason here is dummy whatever is

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:27,439
triggered sales few segments on new

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,439
terrain

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,309
kgm just fired a missile at the BMW r12

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,710
hundred GS collateral damage significant

9
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,440
notably the Ducati Multistrada and zero

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,809
the sticker on here says 1290 super

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,390
adventure are it seems to power itself

12
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:04,128
with the mythical lc8 v-twin now some

13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,590
people say this engine won the car in

14
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,950
2002 and also cut its teeth inside the

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,020
RCA Supersport race bike well sort of

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,850
anyway and then KTM constantly evolves

17
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,440
the elsi-8 so every encounter is going

18
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,000
to be different now this time like the

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,600
Super Duke we see its bore and Stroke

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,450
hollowed out to 1301 CCS it also makes

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,850
103 foot-pounds of torque and 160

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,590
horsepower this is now the most powerful

23
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:35,619
thing on earth with a 21-inch front

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:38,750
wheel cutter Hercules humanity is

25
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:40,280
carving out new terrain for KTM that

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:45,020
it's also eat again

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:49,240
ain't it stop please 160 horsepower does

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,240
not move dirt it moves the earth

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,670
let's take a step back and figure out

30
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,740
what in the hell we've discovered here

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,390
first glance tells me that the frame and

32
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,339
engine are descended from the old twelve

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,250
ninety now relabeled the super adventure

34
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,649
touring but the tank and wheel sizes are

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,049
from the eleven ninety R which was pure

36
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,930
adventure the headlight is totally alien

37
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,980
it's an LED so powerful that it has its

38
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,110
own radiator

39
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,629
a heatsink slash down the center in

40
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,170
order to cool the bulbs the wheels are

41
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,420
spoked

42
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,760
and tubeless alloys made stronger

43
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,679
because the old 1190 front used to taco

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,540
at the first sight of a rut I can

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,940
already see the 1190 guys buying these

46
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,650
and retrofitting most obvious new

47
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,810
features the giant smartphone on the

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,519
dashboard it's six and a half inches of

49
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,829
Gorilla Glass that means it won't

50
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,959
scratch even well then 1290 gets a few

51
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:42,239
crumbs of Earth on it smells now despite

52
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,950
what the puff-piece journalists say this

53
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,379
does reflect a very normal amount of

54
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,899
glare also I could feasibly put a rock

55
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,518
right through the 1298 shiny new iPad if

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,690
I were to drop the bike at just the

57
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,850
right angle is it just me or is this

58
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,040
bike alive it seems when the key is

59
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,810
within five feet making itself ready to

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,790
race or ready for a pint

61
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,980
it keeps an eye on its own tire

62
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,380
pressures it holds its own cruising

63
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,690
speed the 1290 can even hold itself up

64
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,970
on a hill but only if I buy it a present

65
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,739
first and if I do purchase the travel

66
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,870
electronics pack for 600 bucks

67
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,130
I also get smart phone pairing which is

68
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,690
one your human species is weak we'll

69
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,769
start on pavement so you can stop

70
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,769
screaming like a child

71
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,650
the 1290s power curve is extremely

72
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,109
linear it pulls hard pops the front

73
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,760
predictably at 5000 rpm and then keep

74
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,099
scrolling till you hit peak power just

75
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,290
shy of 9,000 then there's a low before

76
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,579
the limiter at 10,000 rpm so you

77
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,799
wouldn't find the glass ceiling unless

78
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,360
you went looking for it only problem is

79
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,980
the plank seat I mean it's great for

80
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,900
shifting my weight back and forth on the

81
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,670
dirt but with a hundred and sixty horses

82
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,110
in sport mode I feel like I'm going to

83
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,488
slide right off the thing there's a

84
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,650
quick shifter included with the

85
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,720
electronics upgrade so I can bang up

86
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,430
shifts with no regard for the clock and

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,109
good thing it works both ways because

88
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,489
slamming down shifts is much more

89
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,860
enjoyable than grabbing the Brembo

90
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,569
brakes with water because the initial

91
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,299
bite is pretty weak and also the

92
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,700
feedback not exactly encyclopedic the

93
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:12,620
handling is insanely sharp though I've

94
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,560
never felt pavement performance this

95
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,478
good on a 21 inch front wheel stiffer

96
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,358
fork springs result in the less nosedive

97
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:22,610
than the 1190 and Bosch cornering ABS

98
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,469
lets me yank believer mid turn without

99
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,419
tucking the front or standing the bike

100
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,400
up and running wide personally I'm

101
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,140
afraid I'll lose my braking skill both

102
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,789
can lever pressure and and manually

103
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,760
bouncing the front with rear input what

104
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:37,610
species is we doing yeah just like

105
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,789
school buses and tanks the KTM 1290 is

106
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,770
narrower than the R 1200 GS all my logic

107
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:45,110
tells me the BMW is still nimbler in the

108
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,310
twisties and I think it is but from

109
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,680
where I'm sitting the super adventure

110
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,770
feels sporty ER due to its smaller size

111
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,750
not as snappy as the old 1190 though

112
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,060
honestly this engine is a little bit too

113
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,039
linear on pavement and there's heaps of

114
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,250
power but it's all potatoes and no hot

115
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:03,250
sauce well shut up you know it's true

116
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,819
[Music]

117
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,280
hey I mean cheer up those sport your

118
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,909
smooth power delivery does make you a

119
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,039
great tour

120
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,810
I remember the 12 volt outlet and the

121
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,270
waterproof phone charging compartment

122
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,820
those are huge touring benefits and look

123
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,349
at your spacious organ omix I mean a 35

124
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,420
inch seat is going to do that for you

125
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,980
the aluminum handlebars the foot pegs

126
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,510
the shift lever the dash and the

127
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,980
windscreen are all adjustable too

128
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,980
although the latter moves in

129
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,540
emasculating two inches allegedly this

130
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,730
prevents my helmet from hitting the

131
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,290
windscreen which literally never happens

132
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,330
but I keep it low anyway because it

133
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,210
buffets less like this and it flows more

134
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,640
air the bodywork to also funnels more

135
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,950
wind to pass my torso the me old 1290

136
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,479
plus k GM put heat guards under the seat

137
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,640
so the header pipe only cooks my ass

138
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,890
medium-rare rather than the medium

139
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,260
welded to 1290 preferred and despite

140
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,450
containing pure hell fire engine somehow

141
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,730
keeps its heat to itself long story

142
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,560
short this 1290 is objectively cooler

143
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,780
than previous versions at least on a

144
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,180
summer's day other luxuries include

145
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,309
cornering LEDs which light around the

146
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,470
bend when the bike feels itself leaning

147
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,720
they're not as punctual as you might

148
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,180
expect initiate a turn and you'll notice

149
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,010
the beam catching up a second later but

150
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,950
hey I mean the thing is are brighter

151
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,320
than the Sun only touring letdown is the

152
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,060
throttle by wire return spring it's too

153
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,820
stiff and so it makes my wrist tired

154
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,380
after a while that and the 23 litre tank

155
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,419
which wouldn't be big enough for a bike

156
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,540
half this powerful I've been getting an

157
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:38,840
annoyingly short 250 kilometres before I

158
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:44,630
hit the 3.5 liter reserve oh nobody

159
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,039
criticisms transformer oh you look

160
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:51,219
exactly the same

161
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,220
ah right

162
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:17,430
this is a different machine limited to

163
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,339
100 horsepower it is world's more

164
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,469
manageable off-road mode also numbs the

165
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,120
throttle response so I no longer carved

166
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:26,580
the Grand Canyon within your engine

167
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,710
drift artificial intelligence run this

168
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,050
traction control it gives me the full

169
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,789
cocky rooster went upright but it wants

170
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,649
to digitally govern the power in the

171
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,479
turn I'm supposed to just slam the

172
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:38,520
throttle and let the bikes here with the

173
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,770
engine that feels very wrong to a

174
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,930
practice risk but don't try to outsmart

175
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,490
the machine because if you modulate the

176
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,529
throttle yourself the traction control

177
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,409
just gets pissed and understeers into a

178
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:51,689
ditch off-road abs is brilliant though

179
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:53,219
it unlinks the front and rear actuators

180
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,559
keeping a tight leash on the former

181
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:58,319
while letting me walk up the ladder the

182
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,949
electronic slipper clutch is also very

183
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,259
robotic

184
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,399
it measures rear wheel speed to detect

185
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,370
chatter and open the throttle

186
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,050
accordingly and it is creepily effective

187
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,539
and I can vomit downshift on the

188
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,370
slippery surfaces and get nothing which

189
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,539
is both amazing and a little bit

190
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,229
unnerving when you're counting on

191
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:18,688
backing the rear riding the 1290 fast

192
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,758
off-road isn't about trusting my skill

193
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:22,709
it's about trusting the computer skill

194
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,129
in transforming this bike for the dirt

195
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:28,439
that's a weird way to ride a motorcycle

196
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:31,050
to be honest the 1290 feels exactly like

197
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,639
what it is a big luxury motorcycle

198
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,889
that's been whipped and tortured and

199
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:39,799
because their behavior it's unnatural

200
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:39,799
and a little bit sad like a caged lion

201
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,780
you know what screw that and the SAR can

202
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,230
turn everything off on the fly give me a

203
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,829
160 horsepower no rider aids offroad

204
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,720
I'll try unleashing you one more time

205
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,880
with a bit of practice I can now see

206
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,650
that the chassis is brilliant

207
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,510
and it's so balanced and slim between

208
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,730
the legs that I'm actually doing this I

209
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:09,170
can actually ride 160 horsepower

210
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:11,240
off-road and hell it is intense the bike

211
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,709
gets it up like it runs on viagra by the

212
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,000
time the front wheel comes back down I'm

213
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:19,160
doing a hundred places I really

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,540
shouldn't be don't screw up now five

215
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,459
hundred and twenty-nine pound boots can

216
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,560
be a problem if I screw up picture

217
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,390
online pick the ticket buddy heaven

218
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,160
forbid I have to pick it up five hundred

219
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,319
thousand pounds with a Munich problems

220
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,870
on the big program but the bike feels

221
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,400
light when it moves it's up heavier Fork

222
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,710
Springs have it riding high in the

223
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,329
suspension stroke like a dirt bike the

224
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,030
knee point seven inch rear shock is a

225
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,100
progressive dual piston offering stiffer

226
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:46,189
compression near the end of travel so I

227
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,620
never bought them out don't watch the

228
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,750
rocks now trust your 9.8 inches ground

229
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,120
clearance and try to forget the KTM skip

230
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,430
the skid click just feather that clutch

231
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,540
it's a piece of straw an extremely light

232
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,540
pull to break the camel's back

233
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:05,690
slippery stuff at the end here no clutch

234
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,460
needed KTM added weight to the

235
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,790
crankshaft so the bike will carry itself

236
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:15,640
near idle just chug along at 1500 rpm no

237
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,640
drama no braking traction and a mouse

238
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:24,339
the 1290 is mechanically one of the top

239
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,110
three motorcycles in the world and it's

240
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:28,449
electronic intelligence is only

241
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,579
surpassed by its brother the S version

242
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:34,420
which touched down in Europe with semi

243
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:37,239
active suspension my frustration is

244
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:40,149
entirely my own I'm good enough to find

245
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,610
the digital age overbearing but not good

246
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:46,350
enough to master the enormous mechanical

247
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,350
potential without them

248
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:56,120
your human species is weak but I called

249
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:59,540
for backup a small board 4,000 dollars

250
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,089
cheaper 35 horsepower smaller and with

251
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,010
less computer-controlled

252
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:07,930
the enemy of the African twin is being

253
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,930
deployed now

254
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,069
you

255
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,199
you
